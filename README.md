# AI Task Creator

**Google AI Hackathon**  
Hosted by Devpost

## REQUIREMENTS

### WHAT TO BUILD

Build a creative app that uses Googleâ€™s Generative AI tools with Gemini!

### WHAT TO SUBMIT

- Provide a URL to your code repository for judging and testing.
- Include a video (about 3 minutes) that demonstrates your submission. Videos must be uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo, or Facebook Video and made public.
- Google Cloud Project ID
- Identify which Gemini API you are using (Google AI or Vertex AI)

## Project Description

The AI Task Creator is meant to be a portal to ease the process of planning. I envisioned it as a product that you wake up, speak to with voice to text and using Google's AI API, takes the input and creates a plan for the day from it. It uses the multi-chat conversational feature of Gemini AI to retain context in a session, rendering plans onto a Trello-like to-do list interface (was supposed to be calendar-styled dashboard).

## Technologies Used

- React Template (Vite)
- Google Gemini API

## How To Run

After cloning the repo, you can navigate to the project directory, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

Once installation is complete, you can run (if needed):

```bash
npm i dotenv nodemon express @google/generative-ai
```

This packages are needed for the backend.

```bash
npm run dev
```

to start the development server for the frontend, and

```bash
npm start
```

to start the development server for the backend.

You can use dev dependencies like concurrently to start both servers together as you like, but if you are not comfortable with that, create a new command prompt terminal in your code editor and start both servers separately.

Please note that you will need to get an API key from ai.google.dev and add it to a .env file in the root directory of ai-task-creator as shown:
```bash
GOOGLE_GEN_AI_HACKATHON_KEY=your_api_key
```
